# Tinyapp Project

Tinyapp is a URL shortening website. While it is a prototype and only works on a localhost for now, it is a working proof-of-concept. You may shorten as many regular website URLs as you wish and even log in!


## Getting Started

- To run this package, you must install `express`, `body-parser`, and `cookie-parser`
- Run the local Tinyapp client using the `npm start` command.
- Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:8080/`
- Enjoy!
